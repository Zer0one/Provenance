Questions, Feature Suggestions, Need Help?
---------------------------------------
We welcome bug reports and feature requests, but try to include as much information as possible and don't post single-line feature suggestions as an issue.
An example of a good issue is one that describes a problem, how to reproduce it and possibly a suggested solution.
A bad issue example are the ones that say "Please support my favourite system!". We don't want those.


For everything else please join our Discord at: https://discord.gg/4TK7PU5 where we would be happy to help you.
